For anyone wondering if the base model is enough, let me assure you - it absolutely is!Here's what I love:Powerhouse Performance: The M3 chip is incredibly powerful. I haven't experienced any lag, even with multiple demanding applications open. This thing chews through everyday tasks and even handles some light photo and video editing without breaking a sweat.Featherlight Design: This laptop is unbelievably light. I can barely feel it in my bag, making it perfect for commuting or travel.Battery Life for Days: The battery life is nothing short of phenomenal. I easily get a full day's work done on a single charge, and then some!Stunning Display: The bezels are practically non-existent, giving you maximum screen real estate. And what a screen it is! The colors are vibrant, the text is sharp, and it's a joy to work on.Incredible Value: You get so much for your money with this laptop. It's the perfect balance of performance, portability, and price.Overall:This MacBook Air is a triumph. Apple has knocked it out of the park with the M3 chip and refined design.

I was expecting it to be smaller, but was pleasantly surprised.The quality of the screen and resolution and whatnots are impeccable. This runs like a dream. Unless you\u2019re just setting it up and then it takes a bit to get going due to all the information you\u2019re logging back in with if you\u2019re an Apple user.The appearance of this thing is beautiful. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen a nicer looking laptop than this one. It\u2019s really sleek looking. Very slim too. Also very very very light, so careful when handling it.The keyboard is practically silent when you\u2019re typing on it.The speed on it after setting it up blew me away and I\u2019m so happy I made this purchase. It feels so easy to use when you\u2019re on it.Highly recommend this laptop to any Apple user that was the M3 chip, a newer laptop upgrade and something to do what you need to off of it.

This one is much better with the M3 because the docks work, dual monitors work, and the unit feels more sturdy in my hands. It travels without issue and the battery life is great. The cons are the changing of the charging port from USB-C to something resembling the original MacBook Air.

The deal was I'd use this for my freelance work for a month while my 2019 Macbook Pro was being fixed and then my niece gets it for college. So it's really a gift, but I got to use it for a few weeks.My biggest grip is that the ports are all on one side, the side that makes plugging things in on my desk awkward. My Macbook Pro has two ports on each side, and I always end up using the right side ports for charging and for the dongle.But I almost never use it as a LAPtop. It's really a desktop machine that I take from desk to desk with rare appearances not plugged into an external monitor and other devices. It is more portable than my Pro but not enough for it to make a big difference. On a small popup desk in a university auditorium and bouncing around campus, this is probably more noticeable, I just don't have the experience to comment.I only use one external monitor but for power users using two monitors the new M3 chip probably makes a big difference. I don't even know if my 2019 Pro with an Intel chip can do this, I've never tried. But I think power users requiring multiple monitors are aiming for the Pro.Running high-ish intensity apps like IntelliJ with multiple apps in the background, I have to concede that this machine is a little slower than my 2019 Pro. But I think that's largely to do with the fact that my main machine has more RAM. With solid state memory being the norm these days it doesn't matter much, and really even high intensity tasks that make my pro's fan start up only take maybe a second or two more on this machine.I'm not an Apple preacher. I still haven't decided whether I like macOS more than Windows. But Apple hardware seems to be better than any PC hardware in this price range. PC laptops seem to degrade faster, mostly the battery. PC laptop batteries go from 18 hours to 2 hours over the course of 5 years. My Pro battery went from 18 or so to 4 over 5 years. And these days you can't change a PC battery with this form factor either.The Pro screen is definitely better, but again I'm using an external monitor 99% of the time, so it doesn't matter much for me.If you're running high intensity apps you should go for the Pro still, but the difference isn't really that huge. If you're doing things that don't involve high intensity calculations this is probably the best machine on the market especially for the money.If you're trying to decide between this and a PC of similar price and reputation, this is probably the first time I'd say Apple is offering a better product for the money. This machine is cheaper than it should be. So it's really a decision between macOS and Windows. Mac has the better command line out of the box but similar Windows tools can be installed just as easily. For gaming, Windows wins, but this isn't a gaming device. The best benefit to macOS for my work is that my employer won't give administrative privs to Windows users, but for macOS they haven't removed that yet, so I can actually do my job without having to ask permission to install an ad blocker in Chrome.

(coming from a PC person)", "author": "Lawrence", "rating": 5, "content": "First off, I'm a gaming PC person. I do digital art as my main career, but wanted a laptop that could help me focus on studies and art. I got an HP Pavillion Aero 13, but it was too distracting. Chromebooks didn't quite cut it... I've used Windows all my life but decided to venture out to try something new to spice up my lifestyle.This is my first time ever ordering a Macintosh product. It came on sale at $849.99 USD from $1,099.99 and saw that it was THIS year's release. I was in disbelief of how big the discount was. I have only been exposed to the Apple ecosystem for around two years now (through only the iPhone and AirPods) and must tell you that this laptop feels GREAT. Even with the 8GB of RAM, everything is going smooth sails, multitasking is a natural and no program has ever felt slow up to this point. Plus, iPhone weaves extremely nice and smooth with productivity.The laptop is SUPER cool, and I have never felt a laptop this chill EVER. It got warm when installing Adobe products but it cooled off shortly after. Running games and art apps was a breeze! Discord, Word and Photoshop were running just as good as my other computers. My only complaint is all my portable hard drives are not compatible since they use NTFS... but since this was intended to largely complete college projects, I doubt it'll be an issue.I recommend this laptop if you want a taste of Apple's computers without spending much. I like having that hybrid world of experiencing both Windows/Android and Mac OS/iOS at my fingertips, so that's another reason why I ordered this.

While it boasts impressive speed and efficiency, thanks to Apple\u2019s proprietary chip, there are significant drawbacks. The laptop remains outrageously expensive, putting it out of reach for many potential buyers. The limited port selection is another frustrating aspect, requiring multiple dongles for basic connectivity needs. Although the Retina display is stunning, the laptop's build quality feels surprisingly fragile for a premium product. Battery life, though decent, doesn\u2019t live up to the hype Apple has created around it.

I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.Specs-I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)Size-I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.Good luck, everyone!", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024", "profile_id": "AHV7PSFY44E3IRU7UN2IOQZMHO6A", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 39, "product_attributes": "Style: 16GB RAMCapacity: 512GBColor: MidnightSet: Without AppleCare+ (3 Years)"}, {"id": "R1XKVCGOMVDOJJ", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars If you are a developer, it is a good option to buy a 16/512 model", "author": "Giorgi Dokvadze", "rating": 5, "content": "This model (16/512) is suitable for those who require more than just everyday work. If you are involved in development (compiling, virtual machines, docker, multiple projects at once) and use a laptop for something more, then take this model. Browsing, listening to music, editing files and pictures - a regular model (8/256) will be enough for you. You don't need to buy anything more powerful.One more note for those looking to buy: fingerprints are not a problem for me, since my laptop is mostly on the table and I rarely move it. The point is different: do not choose this color if it is important for you to clearly see and distinguish the keys on the keyboard in a dimly lit room - on gray models the distances between the keys are clearly visible, but on a laptop of this color - not. On this model, the keys are distinguishable only by the backlighting of the characters themselves. I think this is a very significant factor. If you are not sure, take a gray laptop.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2024", "profile_id": "AHFSYMNIBAFNIP4EWHDDDH2WLXNA", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 1, "product_attributes": "Style: 16GB RAMCapacity: 512GBColor: MidnightSet: Without AppleCare+ (3 Years)"}], "page_type": "Question", "asin_in_url": "B0CX23V2ZK", "product_name": "Apple 2024 MacBook Air 13-inch Laptop with M3 chip: Built for Apple Intelligence, 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display, 8GB Unified Memory, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, Touch ID; Midnight", "parse_status_code": 12000}, "created_at": "2024-08-26 13:11:35", "updated_at": "2024-08-26 13:11:36", "page": 1, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CX23V2ZK?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1", "job_id": "7233823395459105794", "is_render_forced": false, "status_code": 200, "parser_type": ""}], "job": {"callback_url": null, "client_id": 77201, "context": [{"key": "force_headers", "value": null}, {"key": "force_cookies", "value": false}, {"key": "hc_policy", "value": null}, {"key": "check_empty_geo", "value": null}, {"key": "safe_search", "value": true}], "created_at": "2024-08-26 13:11:35", "domain": "com", "geo_location": null, "id": "7233823395459105794", "limit": 10, "locale": null, "pages": 1, "parse": true, "parser_type": null, "parsing_instructions": null, "browser_instructions": null, "render": null, "url": null, "query": "B0CX23V2ZK", "source": "amazon_reviews", "start_page": 1, "status": "done", "storage_type": null, "storage_url": null, "subdomain": "www", "content_encoding": "utf-8", "updated_at": "2024-08-26 13:11:36", "user_agent_type": "desktop", "session_info": null, "statuses": [], "client_notes": null, "_links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794/results", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-content", "href_list": ["http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794/results/1/content"], "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-html", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794/results?type=raw", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-content-html", "href_list": ["http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794/results/1/content?type=raw"], "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-parsed", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794/results?type=parsed", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-content-parsed", "href_list": ["http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823395459105794/results/1/content?type=parsed"], "method": "GET"}]}}
