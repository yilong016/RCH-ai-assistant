She didn\u2019t want the latest iPhone so we opted for a \u201cpremium renewed\u201d phone. I rolled my eyes as I wrote the quote.This was a regrettable, terrible decision. There were many problems with the phone, but I will describe the two biggest issues. First, the power button didn\u2019t work correctly. It became stuck in the pressed position after being pressed a few times. This lead to a constant cycle of the phone restarting. Once the recycling stopped, she didn\u2019t dare try to lock the phone.The second issue is the lens cover came off one of the lenses. The phone wasn\u2019t dropped or mishandled. The cover just fell off and it will not stay in place. Just imagine how much water could have made its way into the phone even if the lens cover had not fallen off.We are returning the phone and just paid a little more for a new phone that will give us peace of mind. When we asked the amusement park about the phone my wife lost, they said we likely would not get it back. I wonder if her lost phone will make its way to this process.We love Amazon, but we won\u2019t do this again.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024", "profile_id": "AFFON2RVPSUFLCBIBBPGUWCOPXYQ", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 14, "product_attributes": "Service Provider: UnlockedColor: GraphiteSize: 128GB"}, {"id": "R3RRQP5W4HPS7B", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great product, but not what I ordered :(", "author": "\u00c9rika Mitsue Todoroki Abe", "rating": 4, "content": "About the seller:I ordered the iPhone 13 Pro 256 GB Sierra Blue on Black Friday with a nice discount. A few days later I received the package, and to my surprise it was a green iPhone with 128 GB. I got in contact with the seller and was offered two options: either return the phone for a full refund or keep it and get a $25 partial refund. Apparently, there was an error with the Amazon listing and they didn't have the one I ordered in stock, even though I was able to complete the purchase. Personally, I wouldn't benefit from a full refund (I used reais - the brazilian currency - instead of dollar, which includes some bank taxes AND I woudn't get the same discount if I tried to buy it again), meaning I'd lose a considerable amount of money either way. I decided to keep it and receive the partial refund, which I still haven't received. I would prefer that they let me know there was none in stock and cancel my purchase instantly instead of proceeding to send me a totally different item. I didn't like that at all.About the iPhone:Although I was very sad with the color and with having less storage than what I paid for, the conditions are great. It barely has any scratches (none on the front or the back, just one or two on the sides), everything works perfectly and the battery health is at 100%. I have tiny hands, so it's a perfect balance between not being uncomfortably heavy and a having a nice, big screen. It's my first time using a camera with three lenses and I've been having fun taking photos. It came with a USB cable that isn't original, but it's new and works perfectly. The battery is awesome, it's a huge improvement from the iPhone SE 2nd gen, my previous phone. I do recommend it.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023", "profile_id": "AGIBZXGBW5FUP4XUDLBSB7CHVWFA", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 6, "product_attributes": "Service Provider: UnlockedColor: Sierra BlueSize: 256GB"}, {"id": "RUMP0Z39YW4FL", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Obsessed \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "author": "Kyo", "rating": 5, "content": "Absolutely love my new iPhone.

Store ran the S/N and said 4 months prior to my purchase someone (previous owner?) had taken it to Apple and Apple determined that an internal component needed replaced for $450 to restore the phone's Wi-Fi. The battery health was also mediocre - I believe 86%. I initiated a return on a Friday, following Tuesday (2nd attempt) UPS picked up the phone, my refund was deposited 3 days later on Friday. Several posted comments about delayed refunds concerned me, but my refund came very quick. Kudos to Amazon for great customer service - as usual. My daughter purchased 2 of these used Amazon iPhones and got great phones - it's hit or miss. The phone I received looked beautiful and would have been a great deal - if not for the Wi-Fi issue... I advise to just ensure you give the phone a thorough inspection when you receive it.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024", "profile_id": "AGSPLK6DJVPR4CP7LA23UNSWKUKA", "is_verified": true, "product_attributes": "Service Provider: UnlockedColor: Sierra BlueSize: 256GB"}, {"id": "R34BNG4YDRRM94", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect. Decent value", "author": "G", "rating": 4, "content": "Review for 13 pro \u201crenewed PREMIUM \u201cPhone seems to be totally functional, is cosmetically in great condition, no visible damage. My only complaint is that the battery is not new. I received it with 91% maximum capacity battery health. You actually pay extra for that \u201cpremium\u201d condition to receive one above 90%. . You are not told if the phone has any replacement parts or if it has been repaired. I think this should be transparent. I feel at ease because of the generous 1 year window to return or replace. I haven\u2019t read the fine print but I believe outside of physical damage you caused to the phone, you can exchange or return it if any problems arise. I feel like the screen isn\u2019t as responsive and precise to touch and that the speaker is very quiet. My boyfriend has commented to me that he cannot hear me as well when I am using speakerphone to call him since I got the new phone.As far as the model I don\u2019t see a gigantic difference between one and the 11 model. The battery might last slightly longer and the camera has better zoom capabilities. I think that the max brightness of the screen is a little brighter. The price I paid is very comparable and competitive with the big sites that sell refurbished phones. Definitely cheaper than Apple of course but when you buy their refurbished phones you get a new battery and guarantee it has all Apple parts.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024", "profile_id": "AE7CREOPE2DIBA5UR3TNV25DT4XQ", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 4, "product_attributes": "Service Provider: UnlockedColor: Alpine GreenSize: 128GB"}], "page_type": "Question", "asin_in_url": "B0BGYWPWNC", "product_name": "Apple iPhone 13 Pro, 1TB, Silver - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)", "parse_status_code": 12000}, "created_at": "2024-08-26 13:12:59", "updated_at": "2024-08-26 13:13:00", "page": 1, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0BGYWPWNC?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1", "job_id": "7233823747206049793", "is_render_forced": false, "status_code": 200, "parser_type": ""}], "job": {"callback_url": null, "client_id": 77201, "context": [{"key": "force_headers", "value": null}, {"key": "force_cookies", "value": false}, {"key": "hc_policy", "value": null}, {"key": "check_empty_geo", "value": null}, {"key": "safe_search", "value": true}], "created_at": "2024-08-26 13:12:59", "domain": "com", "geo_location": null, "id": "7233823747206049793", "limit": 10, "locale": null, "pages": 1, "parse": true, "parser_type": null, "parsing_instructions": null, "browser_instructions": null, "render": null, "url": null, "query": "B0BGYWPWNC", "source": "amazon_reviews", "start_page": 1, "status": "done", "storage_type": null, "storage_url": null, "subdomain": "www", "content_encoding": "utf-8", "updated_at": "2024-08-26 13:13:00", "user_agent_type": "desktop", "session_info": null, "statuses": [], "client_notes": null, "_links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793/results", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-content", "href_list": ["http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793/results/1/content"], "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-html", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793/results?type=raw", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-content-html", "href_list": ["http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793/results/1/content?type=raw"], "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-parsed", "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793/results?type=parsed", "method": "GET"}, {"rel": "results-content-parsed", "href_list": ["http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/7233823747206049793/results/1/content?type=parsed"], "method": "GET"}]}}
