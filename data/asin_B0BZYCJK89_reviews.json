Here are some things I like about it:The SpoutThis provides the best \u201csip\u201d period! It\u2019s so satisfying!

Whether you\u2019re working out, driving, or simply lounging by the pool, the FreeSip spout has your back!Insulation aspect works wellI\u2019ve noticed that anything inside stays cool for 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours.

I\u2019ve found that even after leaving it in a hot car for several hours, my water stays refreshingly cool,Practical DesignI like that it easily fits in my car cup holder. That has been an issue with other insulated water bottlesSECRET!Pairing this bottle with Tan Maxxed Tanning Supplement has been game changing. These two have been my summer friends!Having these two items together all summer has been game-changing. While the water bottle ensures you stay hydrated throughout the day, the tanning supplement has given me a sun-kissed glow from within.Tan Maxxed is designed to enhance your natural tan, providing your skin with a radiant and even complexion. It contains powerful antioxidants like astaxanthin, which help protect your skin from UV damage while promoting a beautiful tan. Taking Tan Maxxed consistently is essential if you\u2019re going to be spending time outside, as it not only boosts your tan but also supports your skin\u2019s health.These products have given me a holistic approach to enjoying the summer sun safely and stylishly.

It's excellent quality.I like that this is dishwasher safe. It is a pain in the behind to have to clean bottles manually and they never feel entirely sanitary. The color is really cute, the size is a good portion for staying hydrated year-round (I can count in bottles instead of cups), and there is no metal taste. I like the dual tip and sip lid with a straw. I'm on the road a lot and feel safer if I don't have to take my eyes off the road to drink.I put ice cubes in it and mislaid it in my house for over 24hrs to find there was still unmelted ice, so if you're like me and your water has to be cold if you're going to drink it, this is your cup.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024", "profile_id": "AH6UKMU6FA7DIZYCPJWLFW543HWQ", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 14, "product_attributes": "Color: Summer SweetnessSize: 24 ozPattern Name: Water Bottle"}, {"id": "R37VT0BACA77RT", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Spill free hydration.", "author": "JB", "rating": 5, "content": "It is the perfect size to fit into the car holder and is incredibly durable, making it ideal for daily use.

It excels at keeping water cool for hours, which is a game-changer, especially on hot days. I especially appreciate the smaller mouthpiece\u2014it's a thoughtful design that prevents spills and makes drinking much easier compared to wide-mouthed bottles, where I often end up dribbling water on myself.

While the current options are nice, a wider variety would really elevate this product. A few more vibrant or unique color schemes would make it even more appealing.Overall, this is a fantastic water bottle that does exactly what it promises, with just a little room for improvement in the aesthetics department.

These bottles come in about 20 different colors, so there\u2019s something that will appeal to everyone. I took it out on my walk today for the first time and it\u2019s very user friendly. The carrying loop (which doubles as a lock when pushed down) is super convenient and comfortable to carry. It was not too heavy even when completely filled and ice was added. I love that you have the option of either tilting it back to take a swig or sipping it through the integrated straw, which I find to be easier while walking. It\u2019s well-insulated and kept my water nice and cold when I left it next to my bed overnight. Easy to clean, but I plan on using it only for water (FYI it\u2019s not intended for hot or carbonated beverages). I really wanted this particular color combination and it took more than five weeks to arrive from the time I placed my order, so if you\u2019re in a hurry you may want to be more flexible on color than I was.

It keeps the drink cold, the part you drink out of is inside the lid so it doesn\u2019t get gross by carrying it around or putting it in a bag. The handle makes it easy to carry.

It keeps drinks cold for a long time, thanks to its insulated stainless steel construction. The straw feature is convenient and encourages me to drink more water throughout the day. The flip-up lid with a lock mechanism is handy for preventing spills, making it suitable for carrying in bags or backpacks without worry.Materials and Build:The materials used in this water bottle are high-quality and durable. The stainless steel body feels sturdy, and the silicone straw is comfortable to drink from. I appreciate that it's BPA-free and easy to clean overall.Maintenance Considerations:One aspect to watch out for is the lid. There are some spots where mold can potentially grow if not cleaned regularly and thoroughly. It\u2019s crucial to disassemble the lid for proper cleaning to prevent any buildup. This maintenance step ensures the bottle remains hygienic and safe to use.Overall Impression:In conclusion, the Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw is a good choice for anyone looking for a functional and durable water bottle. It keeps beverages cold, is easy to use with its straw and flip-up lid, and is made from quality materials. Just be mindful of the lid\u2019s cleaning needs to avoid any mold issues.

Impressive enough that the ice lasted in a hot car in Arizona on a 105F day for several hours but what got to me was the little inbuilt straw when I took a sip of his water.I REALLY liked that it could be fully covered by the cap when it's closed-- far more hygienic than those ones that just fold down.Okay, so that got me onto Amazon to check it out, which is where I found the third and final point that saw me splurging on one for myself: just about everything in the cap, including the cap itself has replacements easily available.Annnd that was that, really.I mean, yeah, my old thermos kept it cold at least long enough for me to finish my water, and I did still have the metal cap even if the handle (like the other cap that had an inbuilt straw) had broken long ago, BUT, I seriously missed the straw feature so I could have a sip while I was driving and I honestly did not know how much longer that remaining lid was going to last.So, yeah, sometimes you get what you pay for. Is this bottle pricey? Oh definitely! But, otoh, it has all the features I could need or want AND I see no reason why I can't be using it 20 years from now.So, if you're debating on whether or not to get this bottle, take it from me and stop debating and just get one already.", "timestamp": "Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2024", "profile_id": "AE6HWLIIYWGLLAMMXFOEXD2N6B7Q", "is_verified": true, "helpful_count": 11, "product_attributes": "Color: Very Very DarkSize: 32 ozPattern Name: Water Bottle"}, {"id": "R1Z1FA48APVPKB", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Are you kidding me?", "author": "Kasey", "rating": 5, "content": "Are you freaking kidding? I wish I had known about this bottle sooner. It's my favorite one I own. Goes with me to gym, work, friends houses, the couch, bed, walking, and everywhere in between.This bottle honestly makes me hurt for those who go around holding their Stanley cups.If you have a Stanley or any other metal cup for that matter, stop, drop and roll and do yourself a favor and get the Owala bottle.Pros:This bottle has a typical pour back bottle mechanism for those of us who don't like straws. But it also has a sip function which I love!The sip function makes it easy to take a sip of drink while driving, laying back (not all the way down) on the bed or couch.The handle makes transporting the bottle easy when toting other things around. And also serves as an extra lock function for the lid.There is a secure cap that locks in place to cover the drinking spout. This prevents accidental touches to the place where you mouth is going.The lid (NOT the bottle body or straw) is dishwasher safe!The mouth piece (for sipping) is very comfortable, though it took me a minute to get used to it. I am used to straws and this was an odd sensation for a few days. Now I feel I can't live without it.The colors are fun and I'm a sucker for a \"color block\" look.Cons:I wish the straw was metal. Plastic straws weird me out and wear down easily.32oz Doesn't fit in most car cupholders and will require an adaptor piece to make it fit. Otherwise you'll have to place it on the passenger seat and it'll be whipping around with every break, turn, acceleration and stop. (Can confirm the main console cup holders on 2024 RAV4 fits this bottle.)Get this bottle, you won't be sorry.Oh and Target sells them, so if you wanna go check out how they look and feel, that's a great place to look.
